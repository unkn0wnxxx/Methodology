When this instance is running it means it's Network Shares and similiar to smb.

## PoC

Enumerating

```
showmount -e 10.129.37.29
Export list for 10.129.37.29:
/site_backups (everyone)
```

Mounting the share

1. Create /mnt/site_backups

```
mkdir /mnt/site_backups
```

2. Mount the remote nfs share to our local machine.

```
mount -t nfs 10.129.37.29:/site_backups /mnt/site_backups
```

Now we can access the share and the files from the remote nfs share are mounted to our local /mnt/site_backups!
