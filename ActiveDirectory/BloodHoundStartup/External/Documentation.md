# BloodHound

can be utilized in order to map the whole domain hierarchy based and potentially elevated privs.

## PoC

Once we have user credentials and an domainname we can use them to gain information about the domain

```
bloodhound-python -u "SVC_TGS" -p "GPPstillStandingStrong2k18" -ns 10.129.161.230 -d active.htb -c all
```

Startup docker since it runs the backend of bloodhound

```
systemctl start docker
docker ps
```

Next step is to start up neo4j & bloodhound with credentials neo4j:HonorShard302!
Startup neo4j

```
neo4j console
```

Startup bloodhound

```
bloodhound
```

In order for bloodhound to work I had to reinstall it manually in an docker environment.
