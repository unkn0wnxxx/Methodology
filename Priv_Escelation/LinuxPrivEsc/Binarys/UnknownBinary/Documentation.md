## Enumeration

When an binary us unknown, our first initiative is to find out what it can do.

```
/opt/fileS --help
```

Assuming the binary was just renamed and is an default binary with SUID set. Let's check for version!

```
www-data@mzeeav:/opt$ /opt/fileS --version
find (GNU findutils) 4.8.0

## PoC

The /opt/fileS binary is an /find binary, we can utilize following PoC from www.gtfobins.github.io to escalate to "root".

```
